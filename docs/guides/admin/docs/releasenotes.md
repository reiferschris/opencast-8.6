Additional Notes About 8.3
--------------------------

To improve the integration of Opencast Studio we introduced the custom roles plugin for LTI.

There are also several changes in Opencast Studio:

- Added
    - Add detection of cameras. If none are detected, the buttons for "Camera" and "Screen & Camera"
    are grayed out and not clickable.
    - Add configuration options for the ACL sent by Studio on upload (the defaults haven't changed).
    - Add configurations to limit the maximum video size and frame rate (the default haven't changed).
    - Add configurations for video bitrate and preferred MIME types
    - Add option to pass full configuration as hex encoded GET parameter.
    - Show "Your recording will now be processed by Opencast." after upload.
    - Full German translation
    - Add build-time configuration of the settings.json path

- Changed
    - Remove "beta" status of Studio
    - Update dependencies
    - Settings are now validated against a fixed schema
    - An invalid Content-Type for the ACL XML request does not lead to the ACL template being ignored.
    Now it's used anyway, but a warning is still printed.
    - Source map files are now included in the released tarballs.

- Fixed
    - Fix bug in parsing GET parameters that would lead to only the last parameter being used
    - Errors during upload are now shown to the user (previously, it would just show "Opencast connection not
    configured").
    - Fixed very short recordings on weak devices leading to an error
    - Fix MIME type to file extension detection
    - Fix Safari detection
    - GET parameters are now retained all the time
    - text/xml is now also accepted as valid Content-Type for the ACL XML request (previously only application/xml
    was accepted)


### Configuration Changes in 8.3

- The configuration file `etc/org.opencastproject.kernel.security.LtiLaunchAuthenticationHandler.cfg` was moved
   to `etc/org.opencastproject.security.lti.LtiLaunchAuthenticationHandler.cfg`.
- The configuration file `etc/org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg` was updated to include the `org.ops4j.pax.web.session.timeout`
   option with value `240`.
- New workflows and encodings for Opencast Studio
- New configuration file `etc/ui-config/mh_default_org/studio/settings.json`



Additional Notes About 8.2
--------------------------

Unlike in other maintainance releases, the release managers decided to break the rule to include features only
in major releases. So Opencast 8.2 includes **Opencast Studio** a browser-based recording tool. We felt that
because of the Corona Crisis this tool would be to many Opencast users as soon as possible.

Additionally this release also includes 17 other patches.

### Configuration Changes in 8.2

- `/etc/encoding/engage-images.properties` has a few optimizations that are needed especially for Studio
- `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` has some changes for Studio and a new ROLE_STUDIO is introduced
- `etc/workflows/publish-uploaded-assets.xml` has some changes.

Aditional Notes About 8.1
-------------------------

Opencast 8.1 fixes a number of security issues. Upgrading is strongly recommended.
Take a look at the [security advisories](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories) for more details.

One change is that the OAI-PMH endpoint is no longer publicly accessible by default.
If you need it to be, you can easily change that in the security configuration at `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml`.

### Configuration Changes in 8.1

- `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml`
    - `/oaipmh` URL is now restricted to `ROLE_ADMIN`
    - Removed `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` that was used for `/` and `/admin-ng` URLs
    - replaced `<sec:remember-me key="opencast" user-service-ref="userDetailsService" />`
with `<sec:remember-me services-ref="rememberMeServices" />`
    - Added configuration for rememberMeServices
    - Added CustomPasswordEncoder configuration instead of MD5
- changed `exception-handler-workflow="error"` to `exception-handler-workflow="partial-error"` in several workflow definitions
