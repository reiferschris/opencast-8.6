* Split: Split the underlying segment at the marker's position on the timeline
* Cut: Marks a segment that should be cut out of the video during processing. The background of the "Cut" segment is red
* Replay segment: Replays the current segment
* Clear segments: Removes all the segments except for one that covers the full length of the video


#### The timeline

The timeline displays the video trak as well as the [waveform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform) of the audio
track. The position marker (red vertical line) can be moved by dragging it with the mouse or by using the Next /
Previous buttons in the [player controls](#player-controls).

The zoom control allows for a more precise positioning of the marker.

  be redirected to the events page.
