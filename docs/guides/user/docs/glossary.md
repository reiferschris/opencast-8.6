# Glossary

## Recordings
A general term used to describe activities that occur within an Opencast system including Series and Events.

## Events
Events refer to a single episode or lecture that is recorded or uploaded. Typically they belong to a Series (see also
Series section), however there can also be ad-hoc recordings that do not belong to a Series. You can access the Events
page from the **Main Menu > Recordings > Events**.

## Ad-hoc events
Ad-hoc events that occur spontaneously and may or may not belong to a Series. An example of an adhoc recording may be a
recording of a dissertation practice or a recording of an unplanned meeting. Note: Not all capture agents support ad-hoc
recordings. Refer to the capture agentâ€™s manual to find out if it has this capability.

## Series
A Series is the equivalent of entire course and typically contains multiple Events (see also Events section) that occur
across a defined period of time. You can access the Events page from the **Main Menu > Recordings > Series**.

An example of a Series which consists of four (4) events:

* Series Name: Better Development Through the Use of Scrum Techniques
    * Event 1: Introduction to Scrum
    * Event 2: Sprint Planning
    * Event 3: Daily Scrum
    * Event 4: Sprint Review Meeting

Events that belong to a Series inherit properties such as Access Policy and Themes.

## Engage Player

metadata

## Publication channel
The location where a video has been published, for example, you may publish your video to your LMS or Youtube each of
these are considered a publication channel by Opencast. A video can be published to multiple publication channels
simultaneously.

## Metadata
Utilized by Opencast as descriptive data to describe the different objects (series, events, recordings).

## Modal Window
A modal window is a graphical element used in Opencast that displays over the applications main window. The modal window
is considered a child window that requires users to interact with it before they can return to the main Opencast
application. An example of a model window can be seen by clicking the edit icon ( ![icon_hamburger][] ) on the Actions
column within the Event table view.

## Capture Agent (CA)
A software or hardware device to record speakers, meetings, lectures, and other types of events. It typically captures
audio and video (VGA/DVI), and, depending on software and hardware support, various video sources.

## Tasks

that instructs the Opencast system on how video is captured, encoded, archived, and distributed.

## Themes
Enable an administrator to brand recordings using intro video, title slides, and watermarks. Themes can be applied on a
per Series or per Event basis.

## Comments

Event needs further review. Comments allow the user to comment, respond, and resolve.

## Presenter
