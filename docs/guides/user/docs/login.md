# Log-in

In order to log-in to the Opencast administrative user interfaces you will need to request a username and
password from your system administrator. See the [Users section](users.md) for more information about how to create
users.

1. Enter username and password
1. Remember me: Set this slider to remember you if you always log-in from the same computer
1. Language selection: Select the language you would like the user interface to display. This can also be changed or set
   once you are logged-in
1. Click the Log-in button

Currently the user interface is translated into German, French, English and Spanish. You are welcome to translate into
other languages, you can find more information here in the [i18n section](i18n.md) of this documentation.

> Note:  There is no self-registration functionality in the Opencast administrative interface. However, if you just
> finished the initial setup of your Opencast instance, you will have noticed the administrative username and password
> in the configuration section. This user can be used to log in with administrator rights and create less privileged
> users.
