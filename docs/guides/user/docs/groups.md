# Overview
By linking Roles and Users, Groups allow for managing permissions and access to resources and certain parts of the UI.
See the [About Roles section](groups.md#about-roles) for more information about Roles in the UI.


## How to add Groups
Groups can be added using the **Add group** button. Roles and users can be selected upon creation of the group.

Note that every group defines a role, and each group member is assigned this role `ROLE_GROUP_<group name>`, which can
then be used in Access Policies to grant a certain action to all members of that group.


## How to edit Groups
Groups can be edited using the edit icon ( ![icon_hamburger][] ). Roles and users can be selected upon creation of the
group. Once selected, all aspects of a group can be edited and updated.

## How to delete Groups
Use the delete icon ( ![icon_delete][] ) in the Actions column to delete groups.

## About Roles
Roles allow an administrator to define permissions on a per-user or per-group basis. Here is a list of some of the role
and what they are used for:

* `ROLE_ADMIN`: This role overrides any other role and provides full access to the users that possess it.

* `ROLE_UI_*`: Are bound to UI elements and endpoint security. They allow/deny access to certain parts of the UI.

* `ROLE_API_*`: These are similar to the ROLES_UI however they protect the external API of Opencast.

* `ROLE_GROUP_*`: A role that is defined by each group and that is assigned to every member of that group.
