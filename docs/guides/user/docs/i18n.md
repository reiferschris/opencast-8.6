Beginning with Opencast 2.0, work has been completed to enable the Admin UI to support local, regional, language, or
culturally related preferences. Examples include language choice, date and time formats and number formats. This type of
work is often referred to as [internationalization][1], or i18n, which is the design and development of an application
content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language. It is often
written i18n, where 18 is the number of letters between i and n in the English word. [Localization][2], or i10n, is the
process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components
and translating text. Localization utilizes the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization to enable
adopters to translate the application into their language of choice.

If you do not see your language and would like to contribute it, or make corrections to current translations, you can
join the Opencast Internationalization team by creating an account (free) on the [Crowdin platform][3]. Crowdin is a
localization platform that will enable the community to control and manage localization in one place, collaborate on
translations and easily Integrate translations into the Opencast development process.
