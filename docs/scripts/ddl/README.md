DDL Scripts
===========

Opencast can automatically generate all necessary tables in your database.  You *should*, however, use the optimized ddl
scripts located in this directory instead.

For more information about database configuration for Opencast have a look at the database configuration guide in our
admin documentation. You can find it [online](https://docs.opencast.org/) as well as locally in
`../../guides/admin/docs/configuration/database.md`.
