Start Scripts
=============

This folder contains pre-configured start scripts for Opencast.

 - *etc-init.d-opencast* is a SysV-init script
 - *opencast.service* is a Systemd unit file

If you are running Systemd, it is highly recommended to use the unit file.

Adjust the path to Opencast when using these scripts!
